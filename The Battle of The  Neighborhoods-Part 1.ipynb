            "source": "#### Problem Background and Description\nManhattan , is the most densely populated of the five boroughs of New York City. Manhattan serves as the city's economic and administrative center, cultural identifier, and historical birthplace.The borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island, bounded by the Hudson, East, and Harlem rivers; as well as several small adjacent islands. Manhattan additionally contains Marble Hill, a small neighborhood now on the U.S. mainland, that was connected using landfill to the Bronx and separated from the rest of Manhattan by the Harlem River. Manhattan Island is divided into three informally bounded components, each aligned with the borough's long axis: Lower, Midtown, and Upper Manhattan. \n\nManhattan has been described as the cultural, financial, media, and entertainment capital of the world, and the borough hosts the United Nations Headquarters. MEG Company produces cosmetic products, they have some stores in Europe but they also want to built a store in Manhattan. They puts lots of work on their Research and Development projects and eventually improved an eyeshadow palet that has tones of colour on it and they also care about human skin health and regulations about chemicals. Before they release the product to the market; MEG Company's manager decide to allocate this project to me. Manager also want from me to build a system that can help in reccommending new places for their new Cosmetic Shop that will open in Manhattan. This will be a major part of their decision-making process. MEG Company want to position for their new shop in high traffic areas where consumers go restaurants, cafes.\n\n#### Criteria\nAccording to information provided by another company that have shops in Manhattan suggests that the best locations to open new Cosmetic Shop stores may not only be where other Cosmetic Shops are located. This data strongly suggests that the best places are in fact areas that are near Italian Restaurants, Caf\u00e9s, Coffee Shops and Hotels. The people live in Manhattan are very social people that frequent these place often.\n\nThe analysis and recommendations for this new store locations will provide us on general districts with these establishments, not on specific store locations. Narrowing down the best district options derived from analysis allows for either further researchs, or on the ground searching for specific sites by the company's personnel."
